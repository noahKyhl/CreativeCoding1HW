A GUI is a "graphical user interface" whereas a CLI stands for a "command line interface".
A GUI provides visuals for navigating a program or accomplishing a task. They are easy to use (GUIs are user-friendly) but can be limited in what is accomplishable through them depending on the design and intent of the GUI. When designed, GUIs are engineered with a purpose in mind, it has been anticipated how users will interact with them and what they will be doing through them, so many don't feel the limitations of the GUIs.
A CLI refers to using the terminal to navigate a running program. CLIs are more versatile but can be tricky to use when not familiar with getting things done through executing commands and such. Once someone is familiar with CLIs they will be much more efficient in completing tasks on their device. Rather than having to sift through different GUIs, they can accomplish a ton by running commands from one place.
